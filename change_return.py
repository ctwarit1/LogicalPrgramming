"""
Given a total due and an array representing the amount
of change in your pocket, determine whether or not you
are able to pay for the item. Change will always be represented
 in the following order: quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies.
To illustrate: changeEnough([25, 20, 5, 0], 4.25) should yield
true, since having 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies
gives you 6.25 + 2 + .25 + 0 = 8.50.
Examples
changeEnough([2, 100, 0, 0], 14.11) ➞ false
changeEnough([0, 0, 20, 5], 0.75) ➞ true
changeEnough([30, 40, 20, 5], 12.55) ➞ true
changeEnough([10, 0, 0, 50], 3.85) ➞ false
changeEnough([1, 0, 5, 219], 19.99) ➞ false
Notes
quarter: 25 cents / $0.25
dime: 10 cents / $0.10
nickel: 5 cents / $0.05
penny: 1 cent / $0.01

Create a function that takes an array of objects (groceries) which calculates the total price and returns it as a number. A grocery object has a product, a quantity and a price, for example:

{
  "product": "Milk",
  "quantity": 1,
  "price": 1.50
}
Examples
// 1 bottle of milk:
getTotalPrice([
  { product: "Milk", quantity: 1, price: 1.50 }
]) ➞ 1.5

// 1 bottle of milk & 1 box of cereals:
getTotalPrice([
  { product: "Milk", quantity: 1, price: 1.50 },
  { product: "Cereals", quantity: 1, price: 2.50 }
]) ➞ 4

// 3 bottles of milk:
getTotalPrice([
  { product: "Milk", quantity: 3, price: 1.50 }
]) ➞ 4.5

// Several groceries:
getTotalPrice([
  { product: "Milk", quantity: 1, price: 1.50 },
  { product: "Eggs", quantity: 12, price: 0.10 },
  { product: "Bread", quantity: 2, price: 1.60 },
  { product: "Cheese", quantity: 1, price: 4.50 }
]) ➞ 10.4

// Some cheap candy:
getTotalPrice([
  { product: "Chocolate", quantity: 1, price: 0.10 },
  { product: "Lollipop", quantity: 1, price: 0.20 }
]) ➞ 0.3"""
